This is a github repository to collect tests for the Show and Guide
classes written by students in Spring 2025 DATA120 at University
of Chicago.

We want to confirm that the Show and Guide classes do what
they are required to do, namely:
- [ ]  Show constructor checks types of all arguments 
- [ ]  Show constructor test with invalid value for network 
- [ ]  Show constructor test with invalid value for description
- [ ]  Show constructor test with invalid value for genre
- [ ]  Show constructor test with invalid value for air_time
- [ ]  Show constructor with invalid value for end_time
- [ ]  Show constructor validates that end_time is after air_time
- [ ]  Show constructor creates all attributes
- [ ]  Show.duration correctly implemented
- [ ]  Show.season correctly implemented
- [ ]  Show.is_primetime correctly implemented
- [ ]  Show.__str__ implemented
- [ ]  Guide constructor checks argument is a list
- [ ]  Guide constructor checks that elements are Show objects
- [ ]  Guide constructor checks that list is not empty
- [ ]  Guide constructor checks if any of the Show objects in the list would overlap in time on the same network
- [ ]  Guide.filter_shows is correctly implemented
- [ ]  Guide.has_schedule_gap is correctly implemented
- [ ]  Guide.total_duratino is correctly implemented
- [ ]  Guide.total_runtime is correctly implemented
- [ ]  Guide.network_runtime is correctly implemented
